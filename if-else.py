# Syntax of If -Else
# if cond:
#     blocks of codes
# else:
#     blocks of codes
# Examples
# a = 500
# b = 100
# if a > b:
#     print("a is greater than b")
# else:
#     print("b is greater than a")


# If-elif-else
# if condition:
#     blocks of codes
# elif condition:
#     blocks of codes
# elif condition:
#     blocks of codes
# else:
#     blocks of codes

# Example
# a = 6
# b = 50
# if a == b:
#     print("Both are equal")
# elif a > b:
#     print("a is greater than b")
# else:
#     print("b is greater than a")


# Short Hand If - Else
# Example-1
# a = 500
# b = 100
# if a > b:
#     print("a is greater than b")
# else:
#     print("a is greater than b")

# Syntax:-
# block_of_codes if cond else block_of_codes

# print("a is greater than b") if a > b else print("b is greater than a")


# Example-2
# Short Hand if-Elif-Else
# a = 6
# b = 50
# if a == b:
#     print("Both are equal")
# elif a > b:
#     print("a is greater than b")
# else:
#     print("b is greater than a")

# print("Both are equal") if a == b else print("a is greater than b") if a > b else print("b is greater than a")


# Nested If:

# if cond:
#     if cond:
#         block of statements
# else:
#     block of else
